which might be helpful for analyzing executables.

## Executable Analysis

### Linux `file` Command

The `file` command identifies the exact file type. 

```sh
$ file /bin/ls
/bin/ls: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=d6c77095e3b751610cb12d68cb6f86fc4084d1aa, for GNU/Linux 4.4.0, stripped
$
$ file /etc/passwd
/etc/passwd: ASCII text
```

### Linux `ldd` Command

The `lld` command print shared object dependencies.

## YAML

YAML (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a data serialization language desinged to be human-friendly and work with modern programming languages for common everyday tasks.

### Special Characters

- `-`: Block sequences, like elements in a `Vec`.
- `:`: Mappings, marks a key/value pair, represents the field name of a `struct` and its value.
- `#`: Comments.
- `<tab>`: Block collection.

#### `-` Block Sequences

Vertically lists elements of a `Vec`, which could be expressed by `[` and `]` horizontally.

The below `yaml`:

```yaml
names:
    - Ruoqing He
    - Bruce Wayne
    - Jim Gordon
# Or in another expression
names: [Ruoqing He, Bruce Wayne, Jim Gordon]
```

is effectively:

```rust
// The `yaml` itself is an anonymous structure,
// I name it `Data` here.
struct Data {
    names: Vec<String>,
}
```

#### `:` Mappings

Represents key/value pair in a `HashMap`, or a field inside a `struct`.

The below `yaml`:

```yaml
name: Ruoqing He
age: 24
github_url: https://github.com/TimePrinciple
```

could be deserialized by:

```rust
struct Data {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    github_url: String,
}
```

#### `<tab>` Indentation

`<tab>` here represents the keystroke to produce a indentation, which begins a new scope and a block collection. In Rust, it could be understood as with each level of indentation stands for a nested `struct`.

The below `yaml`:

```yaml
attendants:
    - 
        name: Ruoqing He
        age: 24
        github_url: https://github.com/TimePrinciple
    - 
        name: Bruce Wayne
        age: 30
        github_url: https://github.com/Wayne
date: 2024-02-16
```

could be deserialized by:

```rust
struct Data {
    attendants: Vec<Person>,
    date: String,
}

struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    github_url: String,
}
```
