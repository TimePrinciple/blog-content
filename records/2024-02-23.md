## VFS

### File System Types Object

The filesystems are structures in the view of Linux kernel:

```c
struct file_system_type {
    // the name of the filesystem type, possible values are
    // "ext2", "ext4", "iso9660", "msdos" and etc.
    const char *name;
    // various flags (e.g. FS_REQUIRES_DEV, FS_NO_DCACHE, etc.)
    int fs_flags;
    // Initialize `struct fs_context` `->ops` and `->fs_private`
    // fields with filesystem-specific data.
    int (*init_fs_context)(struct fs_context *);
    // pointer to the array of filesystem parameters descriptors
    // `struct fs_parameter_spec`. Relate to Mount API.
    const struct fs_parameter_spec *parameters;
    // the method to call when a new instance of this filesystem
    // should be mounted !!!
    struct dentry *(*mount) (struct file_system_type *, int,
            const char *, void *);
    // the method to call when an instance of this filesystem
    // should be shutdown
    void (*kill_sb) (struct super_block *);
    // for internal VFS use, initialize to THIS_MODULE mostly
    struct module *owner;
    // for internal VFS use, initialize to NULL
    struct file_system_type * next;
    // for internal VFS use, hlist of filesystem instances 
    // (superblocks)
    struct hlist_head fs_supers;

    struct lock_class_key s_lock_key;
    struct lock_class_key s_umount_key;
    struct lock_class_key s_vfs_rename_key;
    struct lock_class_key s_writers_key[SB_FREEZE_LEVELS];

    struct lock_class_key i_lock_key;
    struct lock_class_key i_mutex_key;
    struct lock_class_key invalidate_lock_key;
    struct lock_class_key i_mutex_dir_key;
};
```

### Super Block Object

A superblock object represents a **mounted** filesystem. Its definition is:

```c
struct super_operations {
    // method, called by `alloc_inode()` to allocate
    // memory for `struct inode` and initialize it. If this
    // function not defined, a simple `struct inode` is
    // allocated. Normally `alloc_inode` will be used to
    // allocate a larger structure which contains a
    // `struct inode` embedded within it
    struct inode *(*alloc_inode)(struct super_block *sb);
    // method, called by `destroy_inode()` to
    // release resources allocated for `struct inode`. It
    // is only required if `->alloc_inode` was defined and
    // simple undoes anything done by `->alloc_inode`
    void (*destroy_inode)(struct inode *);
    // method, called from RCU callback. If `call_rcu()` is
    // used in `->destroy_inode` to free `struct inode`
    // memory, then it's better to release memory by this
    void (*free_inode)(struct inode *);

    // method, called by VFS when an **inode is marked
    // dirty**. This is specifically for the `inode` itself
    // being marked dirty. If the update needs to be
    // persisted by `fdatasync()`, then `I_DIRTY_DATASYNC`
    // will be set in the flags argument. `I_DIRTY_TIME`
    // will be set in the flags in case lazytime is enabled
    // and `struct inode` has times updated since the last
    // `->dirty_node` call
    void (*dirty_inode) (struct inode *, int flags);
    // method, called when the VFS needs to write an inode
    // to disc. The second parameter indicates whether the
    // write should be synchronous or not, not all fs use
    // this flag.
    int (*write_inode) (struct inode *, struct writeback_control *wbc);
    // called when the last access to the inode is dropped,
    // with the `inode->i_lock` spin-lock held.
    // 
    // This method should be either NULL (normal UNIX FS
    // semantics) or `generic_delete_inode` (for FSs that
    // do not want to cache `inode`s - which results to
    // a constant call to `delete_inode` regardless of the
    // value of `i_nlink`)
    // 
    // The `generic_delete_inode()` behavior is equivalent
    // to the old practice of using `force_delete` in the
    // `put_inode()` case, but does not have the races that
    // the `force_delete()` approach had.
    int (*drop_inode) (struct inode *);
    // method, called when VFS wants to evict an `inode`.
    // Caller does not evict the pagecache or inode-related
    // metadata buffers; the method has to use `truncate_
    // inode_pages_final()` to get rid of those. Caller
    // makes sure async writeback cannot be running for the
    // `inode` while (or after) `-> evict_inode()` is
    // called. Optional.
    void (*evict_inode) (struct inode *);
    // method, called when VFS wishes to free superblock
    // (i.e. unmount). This is called with the superblock
    // lock held.
    void (*put_super) (struct super_block *);
    // method, called when VFS is writing out all dirty
    // data associated with a superblock. The second
    // parameter indicates whether the method should wait
    // until the write out has been completed. Optional.
    int (*sync_fs)(struct super_block *sb, int wait);
    // Called instead of `->freeze_fs` callback if provided
    // Main difference is that `->freeze_super` is called
    // without taking `down_write(&sb->s_umount)`. If FS
    // implements it and wants `->freeze_fs` to be called
    // too, then it has to call `->freeze_fs` explicitly
    // from this callback. Optional.
    int (*freeze_super) (struct super_block *sb,
                            enum freeze_holder who);
    // method, called when VFS is locking a FS and forcing
    // it into a consistent state. This method is currently
    // used by the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) and 
    // `ioctl(FIFREEZE)`. Optional.
    int (*freeze_fs) (struct super_block *);
    // method, called when VFS is unlocking a FS and making
    // it writable again after `->freeze_super`. Optional.
    int (*thaw_super) (struct super_block *sb,
                            enum freeze_wholder who);
    // method, called when VFS is unlocking a FS and making
    // it writable again after `->freeze_fs`. Optional.
    int (*unfreeze_fs) (struct super_block *);
    // method, called when VFS needs to get FS statistics.
    int (*statfs) (struct dentry *, struct kstatfs *);
    // method, called when the FS is remounted. This is
    // called with the kernel lock held.
    int (*remount_fs) (struct super_block *, int *, char *);
    // method, called when VFS is unmounting a FS.
    void (*umount_begin) (struct super_block *);

    // called by VFS to show mount options for `/proc/
    // <pid>/mounts` and `/proc/<pid>/mountinfo`.
    int (*show_options)(struct seq_file *, struct dentry *);
    // called by the VFS to show device name for `/proc/
    // <pid>/{mounts, mountinfo, mountstats}. If not
    // provided, `(struct mount).mnt_devname` will be used.
    int (*show_devname)(struct seq_file *, struct dentry *);
    // called by VFS (for `/proc/<pid>/mountinfo`) to show
    // the mount root `dentry` path relative to the FS's 
    // root.
    int (*show_path)(struct seq_file *, struct dentry *);
    // called by VFS (for `/proc/<pid>/mountstats`) to show
    // filesystem-specific mount statistics.
    int (*show_stats)(struct seq_file *, struct dentry *);

    // called by VFS to read from filesystem quota file.
    ssize_t (*quota_read)(struct super_block *, int, char *, size_t, loff_t);
    // called by VFS to write from filesystem quota file.
    ssize_t (*quota_write)(struct super_block *, int, const char *, size_t, loff_t);
    // called by quota to get `struct dquot` array for a
    // particular `inode`.
    struct dquot **(*get_dquots)(struct inode *);

    // called by the sb cache shrinking function for the
    // FS to return the number of freeable cached objects
    // it contains.
    long (*nr_cached_objects)(struct super_block *,
                            struct shrink_control *);
    // called by the sb cache shrinking function for the FS
    // to scan the number of objects indicated to try to
    // free them. FSs implementing this method needs to 
    // implement `->nr_cached_objects` for it to be called.
    long (*free_cached_objects)(struct super_block *,
                            struct shrink_control *);
};
```

This describes how the VFS can manipulate the superblock of the filesystem. **All method are called without any locks being held, unless otherwise noted**. This means that most methods can block safely. All methods are only called from a process context (i.e. not form an interrupt handler or bottom half).

### `inode` Object

An `inode` object represents an object within filesystem. `struct inode_operations` describes how VFS can manipulate an `inode` in filesystem. As of kernel 2.6.22, the following members are defined:

```c
struct inode_operations {
    // called by `open(2)` and `creat(2)` syscalls. Only 
    // required if someone wants to support regular files.
    // The `dentry` got should not have in `inode` (i.e. it
    // should be a negative `dentry`). `d_instantiate()`
    // with the `dentry` and the newly created `inode`
    // should be called here.
    int (*create) (struct mnt_idmap *, struct inode *,struct dentry *, umode_t, bool);
    // called when VFS needs to look up an `inode` in a 
    // parent directory. The name to look for is found in
    // the `dentry`. This method must call `d_add()` to
    // insert the found `inode` into the `dentry`. The
    // `i_count` field in the `inode` structure should be
    // incremented. If the named `inode` does not exist a
    // NULL `inode` should be inserted into the `dentry`
    // (this is called a negative `dentry`).
    // Returning an error code from this routine must only
    // be done on a real error, otherwise creating `inode`s
    // with system calls like `create(2)`, `mknod(2)`,
    // `mkdir(2)` and so on will fail. If you wish to
    // overload the `dentry` methods then you should
    // initialize the `d_dop` field in the `dentry`; this
    // is a pointer to a struct `dentry_operations`. This
    // method is called with the directory `inode`
    // semaphore held.
    struct dentry * (*lookup) (struct inode *,struct dentry *, unsigned int);
    // called by the `link(2)` syscall. Only required if
    // you want to support hard links. You will probably
    // need to call `d_instantiate()` just as you would in
    // the `create()` method.
    int (*link) (struct dentry *,struct inode *,struct dentry *);
    // called by the `unlink(2)` syscall. Only required if
    // you want to support deleting `inode`s.
    int (*unlink) (struct inode *,struct dentry *);
    // called by the `symlink(2)` syscall. Only required if
    // you want to support symlinks. You will probably need
    // to call `d_instantiate()` just as you would in the
    // `create()` method.
    int (*symlink) (struct mnt_idmap *, struct inode *,struct dentry *,const char *);
    // called by the `mkdir(2)` syscall. Only required if
    // you want to support creating subdirectories. You
    // will probably need to call `d_instantiate()` just as
    // you would in the `create()` method.
    int (*mkdir) (struct mnt_idmap *, struct inode *,struct dentry *,umode_t);
    // called by the `rmdir(2)` syscall. Only required if
    // you want to support deleting subdirectories.
    int (*rmdir) (struct inode *,struct dentry *);
    // called by the `mknod(2)` syscall to create a device
    // (char, block) `inode` or a named pipe (FIFO) or
    // socket. Only required if you want to support
    // creating these types of `inode`s. You will probably
    // need to call `d_instantiate()` just as you would in
    // the `create()` method
    int (*mknod) (struct mnt_idmap *, struct inode *,struct dentry *,umode_t,dev_t);
    // called by the `rename(2)` syscall to rename the 
    // object to have the parent and name given by the 
    // second `inode` and `dentry`.
    int (*rename) (struct mnt_idmap *, struct inode *, struct dentry *,
                    struct inode *, struct dentry *, unsigned int);
    int (*readlink) (struct dentry *, char __user *,int);
    const char *(*get_link) (struct dentry *, struct inode *,
                                struct delayed_call *);
    int (*permission) (struct mnt_idmap *, struct inode *, int);
    struct posix_acl * (*get_inode_acl)(struct inode *, int, bool);
    int (*setattr) (struct mnt_idmap *, struct dentry *, struct iattr *);
    int (*getattr) (struct mnt_idmap *, const struct path *, struct kstat *, u32, unsigned int);
    ssize_t (*listxattr) (struct dentry *, char *, size_t);
    void (*update_time)(struct inode *, struct timespec *, int);
    int (*atomic_open)(struct inode *, struct dentry *, struct file *,
                        unsigned open_flag, umode_t create_mode);
    int (*tmpfile) (struct mnt_idmap *, struct inode *, struct file *, umode_t);
    struct posix_acl * (*get_acl)(struct mnt_idmap *, struct dentry *, int);
    int (*set_acl)(struct mnt_idmap *, struct dentry *, struct posix_acl *, int);
    int (*fileattr_set)(struct mnt_idmap *idmap,
                        struct dentry *dentry, struct fileattr *fa);
    int (*fileattr_get)(struct dentry *dentry, struct fileattr *fa);
    struct offset_ctx *(*get_offset_ctx)(struct inode *inode);
