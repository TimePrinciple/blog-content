## Mangle in Rust

When Rust code is compiled, identifiers (symbols) are normally "mangled" (by default), i.e. transformed into a different name.

For example, a function with signature `pub fn execute()` might get mangled to `_ZN2wc7execute17h5fd59978558d7940E` or something similar.

Mangling avoids collisions when linking multiple creates together. But sometimes mangling might need to be disabled to keep its original name.

### no_mangle Attribute

`#[no_mangle]` is used to prevent a function or a static variable from being mangled when compiled.


## Dynamic Library Loading

### `libloading`

`libloading` is a crate which could be used to load `.so` shared objects at runtime. Which is to say that plugin loading is viable.

Be advised, functions extracted should not be used after `Library` is dropped. If anyone is trying to pass the functions around, remember to pass `Library` along with them or make them *visible globally*.

## Git GPG Sign

Sign a commit with `-S` flag would apply a GPG sign.

### Amend Commit

`-S` flag is also need when amending the commits with `--amend` flag. Typically, use `git commit --amend -S -s` to amend.

### Sign Old commits

`git rebase --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit -n -S -s' -i <HASH>` could be used to sign old commits. The `<Hash>` is the starting point of the range of commits, while `HEAD` of this branch being the end.
